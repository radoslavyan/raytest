To be able to run the React Code it is neccessery to install all the packages and plugins.
They can be found in ReactCode Folder > package.json file
With Visual Studio Code open ReactCode Folder and if all is Ok with
command npm start front end should be able to lounch.
Front end connects to the back end so first its neccessery to run CombinedProject solution.
CombinedProject Solution can be opened and build with visual studio.
There are 2 endpoints that might need to be modified for your localhost 
One at the front end is at file .env.development
and the other at file appsettings.Development.json in .Net CombinedProject solution
